# Java Algorithms: Trees and Graphs #

The basic implementation of a tree (which is really a type of graph) is given in [Tree](./algorithms/Tree.java). A binary tree is defined here, [BinaryTree](./algorithms/BinaryTree.java)

A more generic graph, in which the child node count is undefined and each child node is stored in an array of Nodes is defined in [SearchableNode](./algorithms/SearchableTree.java).
